# CubeZoo - React Frontend Developer Test

## Objective

The goal of this project was to accurately recreate the provided design using **React** along with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Paid close attention to details like spacing, fonts, and colors, and aimed to deliver a pixel-perfect or near-perfect match of the Figma design across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Assets & Design

- **Figma Design**: [Web Design FE Test - 10 October 2024](https://www.figma.com/design/1goWtiL3MnhoSRhIWkBJFK/Web-Design-FE-Test-10-October-2024?node-id=0-1&t=n7UigCj40SBqpk2d-1)
- **Asset Files (Images, Icons, etc.)**: [Download Here](https://filetransfer.io/data-package/H8be0Muf#link)

## Task Overview

1. **Set Up the Project**:

   - Create a **React** project using any boilerplate of your choice.
   - Install and configure **Tailwind CSS** as your preferred styling framework.

2. **Implement the Design**:

   - Recreate the page layout and styles exactly as shown in the Figma design.
   - Ensure responsive behavior, adjusting layouts to fit various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
   - Use the provided assets from the asset files link (images, icons, etc.).
   - Implement hover effects and other interactive features where required.

3. **Responsive Design**:

   - Ensure that the layout looks good across different device sizes, matching the responsive guidelines in the Figma file.

4. **Use Best Practices**:

   - Write reusable and well-structured **React** components.
   - Ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and well-commented.

5. **Optional**:
   - If you are familiar with libraries like **React Router** or **Redux** for state management, feel free to integrate them, although they are not required for this test.
